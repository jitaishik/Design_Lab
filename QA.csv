43,What are the different layers of Autoencoders? Explain briefly.,An autoencoder contains three layers- The encoder is used to compress the input into a latent space representation. It encodes the input images as a compressed representation in a reduced dimension. The compressed images are the distorted version of the original image.The code layer is used to represent the compressed input which is fed to the decoder.The decoder layer decodes the encoded image back to its original dimension. The decoded image is a reduced reconstruction of the original image. It is automatically reconstructed from the latent space representation.,Autoencoders have two layers - encoder and decoder,

47,What are the types of perceptrons ?,Single layer and multi layer perceptrons.,Shallow and deep perceptrons.,
48,What is the difference between a Perceptron and Logistic Regression?,"A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most basic neural networks that we use for classification. For a binary classification problem, we know that the output can be either 0 or 1. This is just like our simple logistic regression, where we use a logit function to generate a probability between 0 and 1.
Simply put, it is just the difference in the threshold function! When we restrict the logistic regression model to give us either exactly 1 or exactly 0, we get a Perceptron model:",Perceptron uses a step function and logistic regression uses a logistic function,
49,Can we have the same bias for all neurons of a hidden layer?,"Essentially, you can have a different bias value at each layer or at each neuron as well. However, it is best if we have a bias matrix for all the neurons in the hidden layers as well.A point to note is that both these strategies would give you very different results.",Yes,
50,What if we do not use any activation function(s) in a neural network?,"In order to capture non-linear relationships, we use activation functions, and that is why a neural network without an activation function is just a linear regression model.",Any neural network without any activation functions can be simplified to a single layer network.,
51,"In a neural network, what if all the weights are initialized with the same value?","In simplest terms, if all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.
In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting.
Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting.",Training will procees normally,
52,List the supervised and unsupervised tasks in Deep Learning.,"Some example of Supervised Learning and Deep learning include,Image classification,Text classification and Sequence tagging

53,What is the role of weights and bias in a neural network?,"This is a question best explained with a real-life example. Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends. Now, a number of factors can affect your decision-making, like,How many of your friends can make it to the game?,How much equipment can all of you bring?,What is the temperature outside?
And so on. These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much. For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all. Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well. The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor.
Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight.
However, does this mean that we can play a cricket match with only one bat? No – we would need 1 ball and 6 wickets as well. This is where bias comes into the picture. Bias lets you assign some threshold which helps you activate a decision-point (or a neuron) only when that threshold is crossed.",Weights and biases help us track our experiments by providing live monitoring of various useful metrics.,
54,What are the common data structures used in Deep Learning?,"The common data structures used in deep learning are lists, matrix,dataframes, tensors and computation graphs.",Tensor,
55,Why should we use Batch Normalization?,"Batch Normalization is one of the techniques used for reducing the training time of our deep learning algorithm. Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logistic regression model, we can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well.",Batch normalisation performs regularisation,
56,List the activation functions,"Sigmoid, Tanh, Relu and Softmax.","Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, Relu, Gelu, Leaky-Relu, ",
57,Why do RNNs work better with text data?,"The main component that differentiates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) from the other models is the addition of a loop at each node. This loop brings the recurrence mechanism in RNNs. In a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN), each input is given the same weight and fed to the network at the same time. So, for a sentence like “I saw the movie and hated it”, it would be difficult to capture the information which associates “it” with the “movie”.",RNNs can exploit dependencies across time steps so they are useful with sequence data,
58,How backpropagation is different in RNN compared to ANN?,"This loop essentially includes a time component into the network as well. This helps in capturing sequential information from the data, which could not be possible in a generic artificial neural network.
This is why the backpropagation in RNN is called Backpropagation through Time, as in backpropagation at each time step.",In RNN the gradients have to backpropagate through multiple time steps.,
59,Why is GRU faster as compared to LSTM?,"As you can see, the LSTM model can become quite complex. In order to still retain the functionality of retaining information across time and yet not make a too complex model, we need GRUs.
Basically, in GRUs, instead of having an additional Forget gate, we combine the input and Forget gates into a single Update Gate.It is this reduction in the number of gates that makes GRU less complex and faster than LSTM.","Since it has fewer components, it involves less computation",
60,How is the transformer architecture better than RNN?,"Advancements in deep learning have made it possible to solve many tasks in Natural Language Processing. Networks/Sequence models like RNNs, LSTMs, etc. are specifically used for this purpose – so as to capture all possible information from a given sentence, or a paragraph. However, sequential processing comes with its caveats.It requires high processing power.It is difficult to execute in parallel because of its sequential nature
This gave rise to the Transformer architecture. Transformers use what is called the attention mechanism. This basically means mapping dependencies between all the parts of a sentence.",Attention mechanism used in transformer is parallelisable,
61,What is Deep Learning?,"Deep Learning involves taking large volumes of structured or unstructured data and using complex algorithms to train neural networks. It performs complex operations to extract hidden patterns and features (for instance, distinguishing the image of a cat from that of a dog).",Learning multi layer neural networks to perform classification or generation tasks.,

63,What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)?,"As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.
Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).","Multi-layer preceptron is a neural nework consisting multiple layers, that is input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.",
64," What Is Data Normalization, and Why Do We Need It?","The process of standardizing and reforming data is called “Data Normalization.” It’s a pre-processing step to eliminate data redundancy. Often, data comes in, and you get the same information in different formats. In these cases, you should rescale values to fit into a particular range, achieving better convergence.",Data normalisation is the process of standardising the data to remove any biases that might occur from higher range of values in a feature.,
65,What Is the Difference Between a Feedforward Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network?,"A Feedforward Neural Network signals travel in one direction from input to output. There are no feedback loops; the network considers only the current input. It cannot memorize previous inputs (e.g., CNN).
A Recurrent Neural Network’s signals travel in both directions, creating a looped network. It considers the current input with the previously received inputs for generating the output of a layer and can memorize past data due to its internal memory.",RNNs can work on data spanning across mutiple time steps while ANNs are unable to do so.,
66,What Are the Applications of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?,"The RNN can be used for sentiment analysis, text mining, and image captioning. Recurrent Neural Networks can also address time series problems such as predicting the prices of stocks in a month or quarter.","Can be used for language, speech and time-series data",
67,What Are Hyperparameters?,"With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, etc.).","Hyperparameters are decided by the users and decide how the traning process will be carried out. The various hyperparameters are learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.",
68,What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set Too Low or Too High?,"When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point.
If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train).",If the learning rate is set too low them the model will take a very long time to converge. If it is set too high then it will start oscillating around the optimal point but never reach the optimal point.,
69,What Is Dropout and Batch Normalization?,Dropout is a technique of dropping out hidden and visible units of a network randomly to prevent overfitting of data (typically dropping 20 percent of the nodes). It doubles the number of iterations needed to converge the network.Batch normalization is the technique to improve the performance and stability of neural networks by normalizing the inputs in every layer so that they have mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one.,They provide regularising effect,
70,"What is Overfitting and Underfitting, and How to Combat Them?","Overfitting occurs when the model learns the details and noise in the training data to the degree that it adversely impacts the execution of the model on new information. It is more likely to occur with nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. An example would be if a model is looking at cars and trucks, but only recognizes trucks that have a specific box shape. It might not be able to notice a flatbed truck because there's only a particular kind of truck it saw in training. The model performs well on training data, but not in the real world.
Underfitting alludes to a model that is neither well-trained on data nor can generalize to new information. This usually happens when there is less and incorrect data to train a model. Underfitting has both poor performance and accuracy.
To combat overfitting and underfitting, you can resample the data to estimate the model accuracy (k-fold cross-validation) and by having a validation dataset to evaluate the model.",Overfitting is following the training data too closely as a result it struggles with out of distribution data that is the test dataset. In underfitting the model fit both the trining and test data badly.  To avoid overfitting we can increase the amount of train data or use methods like dropout or regularisation. To avoid underfitting we can increase the model complexity.,
71,How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?,"There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.
Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.
Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most commonly used method.",The wights are initialised either randomly or by using some statistical prpoperties ofthe data like Xavier initialisation,
72,What Are the Different Layers on CNN?,"There are four layers in CNN.Convolutional Layer -  the layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several smaller picture windows to go over the data.ReLU Layer - it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the negative pixels to zero. The output is a rectified feature map.Pooling Layer - pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature map.Fully Connected Layer - this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image.","The different layers are Convolutional layer, pooling layers, activation layer and fully connected layers.",
73,"What is Pooling on CNN, and How Does It Work?",Pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce the dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix.,Pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimension of the output while trying to maintain the activation in the regions. ,
74,How Does an LSTM Network Work?,"Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behavior. There are three steps in an LSTM network:
    Step 1: The network decides what to forget and what to remember.
    Step 2: It selectively updates cell state values.
    Step 3: The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output.","LSTM is a kind of RNN capable of learning long-term relationships, remembering information for long periods as its default behavior.",
75,What Are Vanishing and Exploding Gradients?,"While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small or too large; this makes the training difficult. When the slope is too small, the problem is known as a “Vanishing Gradient.” When the slope tends to grow exponentially instead of decaying, it’s referred to as an “Exploding Gradient.” Gradient problems lead to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy.",Vanishing and Exploding gradients are problems encountered in deep neural networks during back propagation. In Vanishing Gradient descent the gradient becomes negligible in the initial layers thus weights are not updqated. In exploding gradient descent the weights keep on increasing or decreasing.,
76,"What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning?","Epoch - Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model).Batch - Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we divide the dataset into several batches.Iteration - if we have 10,000 images as data and a batch size of 200. then an epoch should run 50 iterations (10,000 divided by 50).",An epoch is one run of the model with forward and back propagation. Batch defines the amount of data to be used in one iteration. Iteration is one run of the model of batch size amount of data.,
77,Why is Tensorflow the Most Preferred Library in Deep Learning?,"Tensorflow provides both C++ and Python APIs, making it easier to work on and has a faster compilation time compared to other Deep Learning libraries like Keras and Torch. Tensorflow supports both CPU and GPU computing devices.","It's not. According to recent statistics, most papers in the field today use PyTorch instead.",
78,What Do You Mean by Tensor in Tensorflow?,A tensor is a mathematical object represented as arrays of higher dimensions. These arrays of data with different dimensions and ranks fed as input to the neural network are called “Tensors.”,A Tensor is a mathematical entity which represents vectors of higher dimension.,
79,Explain a Computational Graph.,"Everything in a tensorflow is based on creating a computational graph. It has a network of nodes where each node operates, Nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent tensors. Since data flows in the form of a graph, it is also called a “DataFlow Graph.”","All the computations can be represented as data flows. And the data flows throw operations of variables, thus all the tensor operations can be visualised using graphs.",
80,Explain Generative Adversarial Network.,"Suppose there is a wine shop purchasing wine from dealers, which they resell later. But some dealers sell fake wine. In this case, the shop owner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine.
The forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop owner’s check. The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine experts that some of the wine is not original. The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic.
The forger’s goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner intends to tell if the wine is real or not accurately.Let us understand this example with the help of an image shown above.
There is a noise vector coming into the forger who is generating fake wine.Here the forger acts as a Generator.The shop owner acts as a Discriminator.The Discriminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine. The shop owner has to figure out whether it is real or fake.So, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named,Generator and Discriminator
The generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images.",The generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images.,
81,What Is an Auto-encoder?,This Neural Network has three layers in which the input neurons are equal to the output neurons. The network's target outside is the same as the input. It uses dimensionality reduction to restructure the input. It works by compressing the image input to a latent space representation then reconstructing the output from this representation.,Autoencoder is an automatic encoder. It gives the the embedding vectors without even training. It directly give the output encodings by learning the input. It only consists of an encoder.,
82,What Is Bagging and Boosting?,"Bagging and Boosting are ensemble techniques to train multiple models using the same learning algorithm and then taking a call.With Bagging, we take a dataset and split it into training data and test data. Then we randomly select data to place into the bags and train the model separately.With Boosting, the emphasis is on selecting data points which give wrong output to improve the accuracy.","Bagging is the technique of training a model, another model to predict its error, another to pedict error of errors and so on till we require and ensambling them. Boosting is the method of predicting using different models and taking maximum voting or mean of the results.",

84,What do you understand by transfer learning?,Transfer learning is the process of transferring the learning from a model to another model without having to train it from scratch. It takes critical parts of a pre-trained model and applies them to solve new but similar machine learning problems.,Transfer Learning is the process of having a pre-trained model and then fine tuning it to a specific task by freezing most layers and training just some of the final layers.,
85,Give examples of few transfer learning models.,"VGG-16,BERT,GTP-3,Inception V3 and XCeption.","RoBERTa, BERT",
86,What are some of the uses of Autoencoders in Deep Learning?,Autoencoders are used to convert black and white images into colored images.Autoencoder helps to extract features and hidden patterns in the data.It is also used to reduce the dimensionality of data.It can also be used to remove noises from images.,Extract features from data and even reduce dimensions of the data.,
87,What are the reasons for mini-batch gradient being so useful?,Mini-batch gradient is highly efficient compared to stochastic gradient descent.It lets you attain generalization by finding the flat minima.Mini-batch gradient helps avoid local minima to allow gradient approximation for the whole dataset.,Mini-batch gradient descent provides a trade-off between stochastic gradient descent and batvh gradient descent. Batch Gradient Descent better results than Stochastic gradient descent but requires high memory. Thus mini batch gradient practically provides the best results.,
88,What do you understand by Leaky ReLU activation function?,"Leaky ReLU is an advanced version of the ReLU activation function. In general, the ReLU function defines the gradient to be 0 when all the values of inputs are less than zero. This deactivates the neurons. To overcome this problem, Leaky ReLU activation functions are used. It has a very small slope for negative values instead of a flat slope.",Leaky ReLU is ReLU with noise added to it thus the name leaky.,
89,What is Data Augmentation in Deep Learning?,"Data Augmentation is the process of creating new data by enhancing the size and quality of training datasets to ensure better models can be built using them. There are different techniques to augment data such as numerical data augmentation, image augmentation, GAN-based augmentation, and text augmentation.","Data Augmentation is the method of increasing the data by using various methods like cropping, flipping, etc.",
90,Explain the Adam optimization algorithm,Adaptive Moment Estimation or Adam optimization is an extension to the stochastic gradient descent. This algorithm is useful when working with complex problems involving vast amounts of data or parameters. It needs less memory and is efficient. ,Its just an extension and modified version of stochastic gradient descent.,
91,Why is a convolutional neural network preferred over a dense neural network for an image classification task?,"The number of parameters in a convolutional neural network is much more diminutive than that of a Dense Neural Network. Hence, a CNN is less likely to overfit.CNN allows you to look at the weights of a filter and visualize what the network learned. So, this gives a better understanding of the model.CNN trains models in a hierarchical way, i.e., it learns the patterns by explaining complex patterns using simpler ones.",Convolutional neural network is preferred over dense neural networks for image data because they take the spatial information into the consideration. Also less calculations are required.,
92,Explain two ways to deal with the vanishing gradient problem in a deep neural network.,Use the ReLU activation function instead of the sigmoid function.Initialize neural networks using Xavier initialization that works with tanh activation.,We can deal with vanishing gradient problems by making the neural networks shallower.,
93,Why is a deep neural network better than a shallow neural network?,Both deep and shallow neural networks can approximate the values of a function. But the deep neural network is more efficient as it learns something new in every layer. A shallow neural network has only one hidden layer. But a deep neural network has several hidden layers that create a deeper representation and computation capability.,Deep Neural networks consists of more layers than shallow neural networks. As a result the deep neural networks are capable of learning more complex mathematcal relations. Thus deep networks are better provided there is enough computational resources.,
94,What is the need to add randomness in the weight initialization process?,"If you set the weights to zero, then every neuron at each layer will produce the same result and the same gradient value during backpropagation. So, the neural network won’t be able to learn the function as there is no asymmetry between the neurons. Hence, randomness to the weight initialization process is crucial.",We need to add randomness to the weights to ensure not all of them are zero simultaneiusly,
95,How can you train hyperparameters in a neural network?,Hyperparameters in a neural network can be trained using four components:Batch size: Indicates the size of the input data.Epochs: Denotes the number of times the training data is visible to the neural network to train. Momentum: Used to get an idea of the next steps that occur with the data being executed.Learning rate: Represents the time required for the network to update the parameters and learn.,Hyperparameters in a neural can be trained using backpropagation.,
96,What do you mean by end-to-end learning?,"It's a deep learning procedure in which a model is fed raw data and the entire data is trained at the same time to create the desired result with no intermediate steps. It is a deep learning method in which all of the different steps are trained simultaneously rather than sequentially. End-to-end learning has the advantage of eliminating the requirement for implicit feature engineering, which usually results in lower bias. Driverless automobiles are an excellent example that you may use in your end-to-end learning content. They are guided by human input and are programmed to learn and interpret information automatically using a CNN to fulfill tasks. Another good example is the generation of a written transcript (output) from a recorded audio clip (input). The model here skips all of the steps in the middle, focusing instead on the fact that it can manage the entire sequence of steps and tasks.",End to end learning is learning a model which takes input at one end and gives output at the other.,
97,What do you understand about gradient clipping in the context of deep learning?,"Gradient Clipping is a technique for dealing with the problem of exploding gradients (a situation in which huge error gradients build up over time, resulting in massive modifications to neural network model weights during training) that happens during backpropagation. The problem of exploding gradients occurs when the gradients get excessively big during training, causing the model to become unstable. If the gradient has crossed the anticipated range, the gradient values are driven element-by-element to a specific minimum or maximum value. Gradient clipping improves numerical stability while training a neural network, but it has little effect on the performance of the model.",Gradient Clipping is the process of cipping the gradient by setting a maximum value in order to avoid exploding gradients,
98,"Is it possible to train a neural network model by setting all biases to 0? Also, is it possible to train a neural network model by setting all of the weights to 0?","Yes, even if all of the biases are set to zero, the neural network model has a chance of learning. 
No, training a model by setting all of the weights to 0 is impossible since the neural network will never learn to complete a task. When all weights are set to zero, the derivatives for each w remain constant, resulting in neurons learning the same features in each iteration. Any constant initialization of weights, not simply zero, is likely to generate a poor result.",Yes it is possible to train a model by setting all biases to zero. It is also possible to train them by setting all weights to 0.,
